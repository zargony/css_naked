h1. CSS Naked Day Plugin for Rails

CSS Naked Day is an annual event where websites remove all CSS from their
site for one day to promote web standards. More information on this event
can be found on http://naked.dustindiaz.com

This plugin makes a Rails application strip off the stylesheets during the
CSS Naked Day event. It does this by modifying the stylesheet_link_tag
helper to skip including stylesheets into the layout during the event.


h2. Install

Just install the plugin and you're ready to go.

  ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/zargony/css_naked.git


h2. Manual usage

If you manually need to do stuff on CSS Naked Day (e.g. skipping stylesheets
you placed without using stylesheet_link_tag or adding a note for visitors
why the stylesheets are missing), you can use the css_naked? method:

<pre><%- if css_naked? -%>
  <h3>What happened to the design?</h3>
  <p>To know more about why styles are disabled on this website visit the
  <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com" title="Web Standards Naked Day Host Website">
  Annual CSS Naked Day</a> website for more information.</p>
<%- end -%></pre>


h2. Trying it out

To see, how your site will look like without any styles, you can manually activate
the CSS Naked Day mode by overriding the css_naked? in application_helper.rb:

  def css_naked?
    true
  end
